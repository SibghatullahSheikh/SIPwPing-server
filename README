SIPwPing
========

SIPwPing is web server which allows you to check is a SIP server is alive
by using a dead simple RESTful interface. SIPwPing will send a SIP OPTIONS
request to the specified destination and report back the result in JSON format.

Example:

~$ curl -X POST -d '{"target_uri":"test@sip.voice.google.com"}' http://localhost:8888/options
{"timestamp": "2011-03-19 19:04:06.879164", "reason": "Request Timeout", "code": 408}


Configuration:

The sample configuration file should be just enough for everyone. You may 
change the local SIP ports (which is not necessary) or the local HTTP port
in which requests will be processes.
